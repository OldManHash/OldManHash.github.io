      <div>
        <p><i>Thank you for letting me fill out this application! There are just a couple of bullet points that I didn't feel fit well in the other parts above. I have taken some previous classes on basic HTML design in high school, and during my year of college, I've also done some basic level work in Unreal Engine. That was almost 20 years ago now, so I had to refresh all of that knowledge and had a blast doing it. Also, in my spare time, I have built many high-end PCs for myself, my family, and friends over the years (6 in the last year alone). I look forward to hearing back from Prime, have a great day!</i></p>
